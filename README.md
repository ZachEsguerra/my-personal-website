## Features Implemented

- **HTML Structure**: Used `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for well-organized, accessible markup.
- **CSS Styling**: Created a clean, responsive, modern red-accented layout using an external stylesheet with media queries for mobile devices.
- **JavaScript Functionality**:
  - Smooth scroll to the Contact section when clicking the “Contact Me” button.
  - Dynamic active navigation highlighting based on scroll position.
- **Social Media Integration**: Icons and text for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube included in the Contact section.
- **Skills Section**: Categorized skills into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced for easy readability.
- **Project Structure**: Files are neatly organized into `/styles`, `/scripts`, `/images`, and root for HTML and README.

## Design Choices from the Wireframe

- **Modern Font (Roboto)**: Instead of a generic default font, Roboto was chosen via Google Fonts to match a professional, clean aesthetic.
- **Color Pairing**: Red was kept as the primary color (as requested), paired with dark gray text and white/light backgrounds for contrast and readability.
- **Responsive Layout**: Layout was optimized for both desktop and mobile even though the original wireframe was desktop-only. This improves usability.
- **Centered Contact Button**: The “Send” button in the Contact form is centered to improve alignment and user experience on all screen sizes.
- **Image Placeholders Added**: Slots were added in the HTML (`img` tags with comments) for profile picture, about image, and future portfolio thumbnails.
- **Interactive Enhancements**: Scroll effects and button hover states were added to enhance the overall feel, even though not explicitly shown in the wireframe.
